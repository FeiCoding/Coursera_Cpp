1. 
    cin.get() gets one char only
    cin.getline() gets a c-string
    getline() gets an std::string
2. 
    cin.getline() reads input up to '\n' and stops
    cin.get() reads input up to '\n' and keeps '\n' in the stream

3. 
    get() extracts char by char from a stream and returns its value (casted to an integer) 
    getline() is used to get a line from a file line by line.
        1) Normally getline is used to filter out delimiters in applications where you have a flat file(with thousands of line) 
        2) Want to extract the output(line by line) using certain delimiter and then do some operation on it.
